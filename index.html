            An artist who has lost his way in the muck of low minimum wage jobs because his parents kicked him out for being gay. He dropped out of college because he had a psychotic meltdown when he discovered he was trans and socially awkward due to being homeschooled his entire life. He had to spend a lot of time rethinking everything he thought he knew about life and people because he realized he understood nothing. He picked up a job at kfc to see if he could understand how average everyday people worked. He then later got kicked out for taking estrogen and going on a date with a dude. Scary!!! After that conundrum he had to find a new place to live and a second job at a warehouse. He is now working two jobs. He has made boyfriends, friends, and allies along the way but he now knows that if he does not move forward in his career he will not survive and be able to work on the things he loves. Despite the drawbacks, he will not let the flames die out.
